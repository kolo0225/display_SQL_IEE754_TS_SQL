                               
							test parameters:
                  			                ------------------

1. Permanent Values: 
---------------------------
RampRate = 1 % 
	& does not change during the test

2. Initial Conditions: 
-------------------------------
time_limit = not time restrictions
this_is_the_name_of_the_1st_variable =  10
this_is_the_name_of_the_2nd_variable = 10
this_is_the_name_of_the_3rd_variable = between 10 & 10.1

** Note: 
	this_is_the_name_of_the_3rd_variable
		needs to be stabilized for 
		10000 ms
		in order for the test to continue


3. Changing Conditions: 
------------------------------

this_is_the_name_of_the_1st_variable =  15

Time allowed for 
	this_is_the_name_of_the_2nd_variable 
	to reach between 14.5 & 15.5 is:
	5000 ms

Enough time is provided for 
	this_is_the_name_of_the_3rd_variable
	to reach value below (variable not tested):
this_is_the_name_of_the_3rd_variable = between 14.9 & 15.1

 Note: 
	this_is_the_name_of_the_3rd_variable
	needs to be stabilized for 10000 ms
	in order for the test to continue

4. Final Conditions:
----------------------------

this_is_the_name_of_the_1st_variable =  0

Time allowed for 
	this_is_the_name_of_the_2nd_variable 
	to reach between -0.5 & 0.5 is:
	15000 ms

** Note: 
	At this point the value of the 
		this_is_the_name_of_the_3rd_variable
		is irrelevant for the test
